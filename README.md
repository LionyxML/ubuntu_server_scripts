Some scripts to ease life in ubuntu server

# IMPORTANT!
DO NOT run scripts without looking inside and understanding what
it does first!

None are well tested and or well built, use them for reference only.

Use at your own risk.

Run this sequence of commands from ubuntu's terminal.

```
wget https://github.com/LionyxML/ubuntu_server_scripts/blob/main/minimumX.sh
chmod a+x minimumX.sh
./minimumX.sh
```
And now you're ready to start X with `startx` command.
